        <p>The first-generation Camaro debuted in September 1966, for the 1967 model year, up to 1969 on a new rear-wheel drive
          GM F-body platform and was available as a two-door coupe or convertible with 2+2 seating, and a choice of 230 cu in (3.8 L),
          250 cu in (4.1 L) inline-6 or 302 cu in (4.9 L), 307 cu in (5.0 L), 327 cu in (5.4 L), 350 cu in (5.7 L), and 396 cu in
          (6.5 L) V8 powerplants. Concerned with the runaway success of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet executives realized that their
          compact sporty car, the Corvair, would not be able to generate the sales volume of the Mustang due to its rear-engine design,
          as well as declining sales, partly due to the negative publicity from Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe at Any Speed. Therefore,
          the Camaro was touted as having the same conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration as the Mustang and Chevy II Nova.
          In addition, the Camaro was designed to fit a variety of power plants in the engine bay. The first-generation Camaro lasted
          until the 1969 model year and eventually inspired the design of the new retro fifth-generation Camaro.
          The first-generation offered a standard, Super Sport, and Rally Sport editions. In 1967, the Z/28 model was added featuring
          stripes on the hood and trunk, styled rally road wheels, and a 302 cu in (4.9 L) V8 engine.
          In the Rally Sport edition it was more the style of the car itself. Placed with the hideaway headlights, wing windows,
          and the more rounded out rear fender. Once they brought out the 1968 year they introduced the use of side marker lights.
          With the 1969 Camaro they did not have the wing windows as placed on the 1967 as well as having a more flat drawn out rear
          fender.
