        <p>The Pontiac Firebird was an American automobile built by Pontiac from the 1967 to 2002 model years. Designed as a pony car
          to compete with the Ford Mustang and Mercury Cougar, it was introduced on February 23, 1967, simultaneous with GM's Chevrolet
          division platform-sharing Camaro. This also coincided with the release of the 1967 Mercury Cougar, Ford's upscale,
          platform-sharing version of the Mustang.
          The name "Firebird" was also previously used by GM for the General Motors Firebird 1950s and early 1960s concept cars.
          A distinctive, slant-nose facelift occurred in 1977. There is a way to tell an early 1977 built car as there was a production
          change in the hood scoop. Early cars were supplied with an off-center scoop. Furthermore, early W72 cars came with the
          standard 180 hp air cleaner. Pontiac offered the T/A 400 cu in (6.6 L) with a single 4-barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor
          RPO W72 rated at 200 bhp (203 PS; 149 kW) at 3600 rpm and a maximum torque of 325 lb⋅ft (441 N⋅m) at 2400 rpm, as opposed to
          the regular 6.6 Litre 400 (RPO L78) rated at 180 hp (134 kW). The T/A 6.6 equipped engines had chrome valve covers, while the
          base 400 engines had painted valve covers. In addition, California and high-altitude cars received the Olds 403 engine,
          which offered a slightly higher compression ratio and a more usable torque band than the Pontiac engines of 1977.
