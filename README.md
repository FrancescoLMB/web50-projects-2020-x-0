Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello,

I'm Francesco Lombardo from Italy and here is a description of my project.
I created a web site based on american muscle cars: in the index page there is
only a list of cars that users can choose to see through an unordered list. By
clicking on one of this elements, the user will be redirected to the correspondent
page relative to a specific car model. In those pages it's possible to see a car 
description, with an associate immage and a table that resume the car specification.

To do this, I followed all requirements provided by professors.
