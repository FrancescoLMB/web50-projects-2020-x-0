        <p>The Dodge Charger is a model of automobile marketed by Dodge.
          The first Charger was a show car in 1964.[1][2] A 1965 Charger II concept car had a remarkable resemblance to the 1966
          production version. There have been several different production variants of Chargers, built on three different platforms
          and sizes. In the United States, the Charger nameplate has been used on subcompact hatchbacks, full-size sedans, muscle cars,
          and personal luxury coupes. The current version is a four-door sedan. First generation: 1968â€“1970: the Charger was redesigned
          for 1968, and an initial 35,000 units were slated for production. The demand was high and 96,100 Dodge Chargers were actually
          produced. Based on the Chrysler B platform, the model years received various cosmetic changes to the exterior and interior
          including: an undivided grill, rounded tail lights, and hidden headlights. The powertrains were the same as the ones used in
          the 1967 Charger. The model was not successful in stock car racing such as NASCAR. A more aerodynamic shape formed the Charger
          500 model that became the basis for the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona.
