        <p>The Chevrolet Corvette (C3) is a sports car that was produced from 1967 to 1982 by Chevrolet for the 1968 through 1982
          model years. Engines and chassis components were mostly carried over from the previous generation, but the body and
          interior were new. It set new sales records with 53,807 produced for the 1979 model year.[4] The C3 is the third generation
          of the Chevrolet Corvette, and marks the second time the Corvette would carry the Stingray name, though only for
          the 1969 - 1976 model years. This time it was a single word as opposed to Sting Ray as used for the 1963 - 1967
          C2 generation. The name would then be retired until 2014 when it was re-introduced with the release of the C7.
          The Corvette C3 was patterned after the Mako Shark II designed by Larry Shinoda. Executed under Bill Mitchell's
          direction, the Mako II had been initiated in early 1964. Once the mid-engined format was abandoned, the Shinoda/Mitchell
          car was sent to Chevrolet Styling under David Holls, where Harry Haga's studio adapted it for production on the existing
          Stingray chassis. The resulting lower half of the car was much like the Mako II, except for the softer contours. The concept
          car's name was later changed to Manta Ray. The C3 also adopted the "sugar scoop" roof treatment with vertical back window
          from the mid-engined concept models designed by the Duntov group. It was intended from the beginning that the rear window
          and that portion of the roof above the seats to be removable. The "Shark" has the distinction of being introduced to the
          motoring public in an unorthodox—and unintended—fashion. GM had tried their best to keep the appearance of the upcoming car
          a secret, but the release of Mattel's die-cast Hot Wheels line several weeks before the C3's unveiling had a certain version
          of particular interest to Corvette fans: the "Custom Corvette", a GM-authorized model of the 1968 Corvette.
