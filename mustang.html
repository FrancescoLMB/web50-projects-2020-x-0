        <p id="p1">The 1967 model year Mustang was the first significant redesign of the original model. Ford's designers began drawing up
           a larger version even as the original was achieving sales success, and while "Iacocca later complained about the
           Mustang's growth, he did oversee the redesign for 1967 . The major mechanical feature was to allow the installation
           of a big-block V8 engine. The overall size, interior and cargo space were increased. Exterior trim changes included
           concave taillights, side scoop (1967 model) and chrome (1968 model) side ornamentation, square rear-view mirrors, and
           usual yearly wheel and gas cap changes. The 1967 Deluxe Interior was revised, discontinuing the embossed running horse
           motif on the seat backs (the source for the "pony interior" nickname) in favor of a new deluxe interior package, which
           included special color options, brushed aluminum (from August 1966 production) or woodgrain dash trim, seat buttons, and
           special door panels. The hardtop also included upholstered quarter trim panels, a carryover from the 1965 - 1966 deluxe
           interior.
